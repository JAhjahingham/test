            <h3>🏠 The Stage: An Adventurer's Introduction</h3>
            <p>Greetings, friends and foes! I am Bramble B. Dune, a **Bard of the College of Valor**, adventurer, and proud son of the **Wolf Paw** region. I trade in tales, tunes, and well-placed cutting words. Need a history lesson? A motivational anthem? Or just a rousing drinking song? You've found your performer.</p>

            <h3>🌲 The Wolf Paw Chronicle (Backstory)</h3>
            <p>Wolf Paw is a small settlement nestled deep within the Whisperwood, where the shifting moon is the only clock we trust. My pack always told tales of the great world beyond the trees. I left not to find a home, but to find the **stories** that will define my pack's future. I am recording history with every step.</p>

                <h4>The Bloody Bargain (Moon's Ascent, Day 4)</h4>
                <p>We faced down the Grinning Gnoll pirates at the docks! I managed to distract their captain with a truly moving ballad about his mother's poor life choices. We set sail at dawn, slightly poorer but much more experienced.</p>

                <h4>Under the Red Moon (Harvest Tide, Day 12)</h4>
                <p>My shifter instincts saved the day when we were ambushed in the swamp. The mud ruined my boots, but the song I composed about the stench was a masterpiece. We found the first sigil!</p>
